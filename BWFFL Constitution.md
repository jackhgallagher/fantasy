## __Draft__ ##

### Draft Details ### 

- The draft will consist of 16 rounds of a snake-style draft.
- The draft order will be picked randomly.
- By the end of the draft, you must have drafted a team that includes all of your starting lineup, i.e. not drafting a kicker or DST and picking one up prior to Week 1 is not permitted.

### Draft Pick Trading ###

- Trading draft order slots is permitted.
- Trading individual draft picks is not (would be messy and take up too much time).
  - With the exception of when they are compensation for a draft order slot trade.
  - Example:
  - *Team01* can swap draft slots with *Team12*, and be compensated with *Team12's* 6th round pick.
  - But *Team01* may not trade their 4th and 6th round picks in exchange for *Team07's* 3rd round pick.

## __Keepers__ ##

- A player is eligible to be kept if:
  - They were drafted in the 8th round or later in the prior year's draft, and
  - They were kept on that owner's roster for the entire previous fantasy season.
- Keepers take the place of that owner's 16th round pick.
- Keepers may not be kept for more than one year.
- Keepers must be selected by a certain pre-draft date set by the Commissioner.

## __Divisions__ ##

- There will be 3 divisions, each with 4 teams.
- Every year, the divisions will be shuffled, with draft slots 1-4 in the West division, slots 5-8 in the Central division, and slots 9-12 in the East division.

## __Schedule__ ##

### Weeks 1-13 - Regular Season ###

- Every week, each team plays two other teams.

### Weeks 14-16 - Toilet Bowl ###

- Concurrent with the playoffs is the consolation Toilet Bowl. 
- Each of the 6 non-playoff teams compete.
- A team's score is the sum of their top 2 scores in Weeks 14-16 (their lowest score is dropped).

## __Transactions__ ##

All transactions are $3 Your roster must be legal at all times.

### Waivers ###
- Waivers run every Wednesday morning, based on reverse order of standings.
- Waivers also run daily for any players dropped that week (with a 1-day delay)
  - e.g. if a player is dropped on a Thursday, he may be picked up off waivers Saturday morning.

### Add/Drops ###
- Add/Drops can be made any time after waivers run on Wednesday morning.

### Trades ###
- Trades require commissioner approval.
- Trades may only be vetoed by the commish for two reasons: (a) there exists a reasonable suspicion of collusion, or (b) it is so completely lopsided that it palpably disrupts the league's competition. 
- In the event of (a) or (b), the commish will reach out to the owners to explain their thinking. If the commish still believes the trade to be worthy of veto, they will explain their rationale to the league, and barring pushback from non-involved teams, veto the trade.
- The trade deadline is the Sunday of Week 13, the final week of the regular season.
