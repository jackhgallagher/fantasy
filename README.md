## __Communication__ ##

### Commissioner ###
__Jack Gallagher__

> jackgal98@gmail.com

> (609) 468-5982

### Site ###

> The league is hosted on MyFantasyLeague. The MFL system allows for communication through the chatbox and through home page modules that the commish will keep updated.

### Chat ###

> There will also be a GroupMe chat for everyone in the league. This is definitely the easiest way of communicating as a group and for direct messages. 

<br><br>

## __Money__ ##

### Fees ###
> The league buy-in is $67. $60 goes towards the pot, the other $7 goes towards paying for the year of MFL.

> All money collection will be handled by LeagueSafe. Annual league dues will be due the week before the Rookie Draft.

### __Payouts__ ###

- 1st place: $300
- 2nd place: $180
- 3rd place: $60
- Regular season high points: $50
- Regular season weekly high score: $10/week

<br><br>

## __Basic Rules__ ##

> I'm definitely open to changing rules. 60% of the league must vote yes to any rule change, with the commish's vote being worth 1.5 votes.

> However, the following items cannot be changed, since they're an integral part of why I created this league in the summer of 2015:

- 12 owners
- IDP
- 6 pt/Passing TD
- PPR
- Not using an auction
- No trade veto system being put into place

<br><br>

## __League Calendar__ ##

> The league year begins the Tuesday after Week 16.

## __Rookie/FA Draft__ ##

### Draft ### 

- Each year, sometime in the month of May, we will hold a 7-round rookie draft on MFL.
- The order of the 1st thru 9th picks will be based on potential points scored (PP) during Weeks 1-13 from the previous season, in ascending order. All teams who did not place 1st, 2nd, 3rd are ranked by PP, regardless of if they made the playoffs.
- The 10th/11th/12th picks will be given to the 3rd/2nd/1st place finishers, respectively.
- All players in the NFL not on rosters are eligible to be picked, as are devys.
- Roster limits are completely relaxed during the rookie draft, in order to make it easier to just draft and not have to worry about having to cut a player for every pick.
- Any clear abuse of this rule will be reversed and the owner scorned by the commish.
- In the week after the rookie draft, everyone must cut back down to the normal 45 players.

<br><br>

### Future Pick Trading ###
- Only picks up to 2 years in the future are able to be traded, i.e. in the year 2019, picks thru the 2021 rookie draft are able to be traded.
- Trading future 1st or 2nd round picks requires the owner to pre-pay $35 for each year they lose a 1st or 2nd round pick. This rule is in place to prevent selling off one's future and then abandoning the league.

<br><br>

## __Divisions__ ##

- There will be 2 divisions, each with 6 teams.
- Every year, the divisions will be shuffled, with teams with an odd pick number in the rookie draft order in one divisons, even picks in the other.

<br><br>

## __Schedule__ ##

### Weeks 1-13: Regular Season ###

- Every week, each team plays one other team.
- Each team plays every other team once, and two other teams twice.

### Weeks 14-16: Playoffs ###

#### Playoff Seeeding ####

- Seed 1: Division winner with highest record (total points as tiebreaker)
- Seed 2: Other division winner
- Seed 3: Remaining team with highest record (total points as tiebreaker)
- Seed 4: Remaining team with 2nd-highest record
- Seed 5: Remaining team with 3rd-highest record
- Seed 6: Remaining team with most points scored (record as tiebreaker)

#### Week 14 ####

- Seeds 1 and 2 receive a bye.
- Seed 3 plays Seed 6.
- Seed 4 plays Seed 5. 

#### Week 15 ####

- Seed 1 plays the worst remaining seed.
- Seed 2 plays the best remaining seed.

#### Week 16 ####

- The winners of the two Week 15 matchups play for the championship.
- The losers of the two Week 15 matchups play for 3rd place.

#### Playoff Transactions ####

- FAAB pickups are open to all teams throughout the playoffs, even those teams who did not make the playoffs.

### Week 17 ###

- No matchups.
- Start of the next league year.

<br><br>

## __Transactions__ ##

All transactions are free. Your roster must be legal by the start of Sunday's games.

### FAAB Auctions ###
- All add/drops are conducted via FAAB, throughout both the season and offseason. At the start of each league year in Week 17, every team is reset to $100 FAAB, which is their budget until the next season's Week 17.
- $0 bids are allowed.
- Tie bids are resolved using the MFL default: whoever submitted the bid first gets the player.

### Trades ###
- Trades are automatically processed.
- Trades may only be vetoed by the commish for two reasons: (a) there exists a reasonable suspicion of collusion, or (b) it is so completely lopsided that it palpably disrupts the league's competition. 
- In the event of (a) or (b), the commish will reach out to the owners to explain their thinking. If the commish still believes the trade to be worthy of veto, they will explain their rationale to the league, and barring pushback from non-involved teams, veto the trade.
- There is no trade deadline, but extra discretion will be in force for trades occurring during or near the playoffs.

### Developmental (Devy) Player ###
- Only requirement is that he is not in the NFL (college players, CFL players, high schoolers, pee-wee players, whatever you want)
- Devys can only be picked in the rookie draft, and may only be drafted by teams without a devy already on their roster.
- Once drafted into the NFL, a devy is added to a team's "real" roster.
