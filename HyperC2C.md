## __Intro__ ##

Hyper C2C is a twist on the Campus2Canton fantasy ruleset. The focus of this league is to identify college talent prior to the distracting hivemind period of January - April. What sets this league apart from normal C2C? *The only way to own a player is to have picked him* **prior** *to his last year at college*. This league is a best-ball, no-trade devy league. If a player isn't picked up prior to their last year at college by any owner, none of us get to use him at the pro level!

Payouts will be based around college football awards (Heisman, Biletnikoff, etc.) and, from year 4 onwards, a "normal" fantasy league. There will be no college fantasy football league--the goal is predicting NFL success.

## __Communication__ ##

### Commissioner ###

- Jack Gallagher
- Email: jackgal98@gmail.com
- Phone: (609) 468-5982

### Site ###

- The league is hosted on Fantrax. This will be the first league I'm commishing on Fantrax, so if we find that MFL would be better for the NFL fantasy league in a couple years, we can discuss switching.

### Chat ###

- There will also be a GroupMe chat for everyone in the league. This is definitely the easiest way of communicating as a group and for direct messages. 

## __Money__ ##

### Fees ###

- The league buy-in is $40 for college awards and $40 for the fantasy NFL season, beginning in 2024.

- All money collection will be handled by LeagueSafe. Annual league dues will be due the week before the Rookie Draft.

- A spreadsheet containing a summary of everyone's current balances [may be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r5HpY153OTXROwGiH4KIZ-GTFk-uRxrDp8emFcNkj5o/).

### __Payouts__ ###

**College Awards**

- Fred Biletnikoff Award winner (best WR): $40

## __Basic Rules__ ##

- Hyper C2C will focus on college scouting, thus honing our rookie draft skill for our other dynasty leagues!
- No add/drops or trades any time! Your only way to get players is to have drafted them in the college player draft in April. 
- Best ball! This league is designed to have all the work of managing your roster done in the spring, thus not adding yet another league we have to deal with wavier or start/sit decisions in-season. 
- I'm definitely open to changing rules. 7.5 votes are needed to pass any rule change, with the commish's vote being worth 1.5 votes.

## __League Calendar__ ##

- Our annual, 10-round college player draft will be held each April.
- The orphan supplemental draft, if necessary, will be held in May.
- Once our NFL fantasy season kicks off in 2024, we will have a "normal" dynasty fantasy schedule:

| Segment | Item | Description |
| ------ | ----------- | - |
| Weeks 1-14 | Regular season | Each team plays each other once, plus playing both teams in their division twice. |
| Week 15 | Playoff Quarterfinals | Seed #3 plays Seed #6, Seed #4 plays Seed #5 |
| Week 16 | Playoff Semifinals | Seed #1 plays lowest remaining seed. Seed #2 plays highest remaining seed. |
| Week 17 | Playoff Finals | Winners of two Week 16 games play in championship. Losers of two Week 16 games play in 3rd place consolation game. |
| April | College Player Draft |
| May | Supplemental Orphan Draft |
| September 1 | Cut-down | All teams must cut down to 40 players (in years 4+) |

## __College Player Draft__ ##

### Draft ### 

- Each year, sometime in the month of April, we will hold a 10-round linear rookie draft on Fantrax.
- For the first season (where this draft will be held in late August/early September), the draft order will be set at random.
- For the next two seasons, the draft order will be in reverse order of College Award money winnings.
- Once our inaugural NFL season occurs in the fall of 2024:
    - The order of the 1st thru 9th picks will be based on potential points scored (PP) during Weeks 1-14 of the previous season, in ascending order. All teams who did not place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd are ranked by PP, regardless of if they made the playoffs.
    - The 10th/11th/12th picks will be given to the 3rd/2nd/1st place finishers, respectively.
- All players who are currently enrolled in a college football program, *or* are a high school senior graduating that spring are eligible to be drafted.

## __Divisions__ ##

- There will be 4 divisions, each with 3 teams.
- These are used only for scheduling purposes.

## Lineups ##

### Starting Lineup ###
- 1 QB
- 1 RB
- 1 WR
- 1 TE
- 4 Flex RB/WR/TE

### Roster Limits ###
- Starters: 8 players
- Bench: 32 players
- No positional maximums
- 4 IR slots, players must be listed as Out, on IR, or on PUP to be put on IR.
  - Once on IR, however, an owner may keep a player in an IR slot even after they are e.g. upgraded to Questionable. Whatever the system allows them to do, they may do. 
  - For example, MFL doesn't give you a score of 0 for an IR violation, but also doesn't allow you to submit a different lineup or perform an add/drop.

### Devy ###
- A developmental player
- Only requirement is that he is not in the NFL (college players, CFL players, high schoolers, whatever)
- Devys can only be picked in the rookie draft, and may only be drafted by teams without a devy already on their roster.
- If the player is already loaded into the system, they can be drafted the same as any other player. If not, send a message to the commish, who can manually add the player and draft him to your team.
- Once drafted into the NFL, a devy is added to a team's "real" roster.
- It is possible for a team to own more than devy, since they may trade for another team's devy who was previously acquired in a rookie draft.
