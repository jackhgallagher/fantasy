## __Intro__ ##

Hyper C2C is a twist on the Campus2Canton fantasy ruleset. The focus of this league is to identify college talent prior to the distracting hivemind period of January - April. What sets this league apart from normal C2C? *The only way to own a player is to have picked him* **prior** *to his last year at college*. This league is a best-ball, no-trade devy league--there's very little in-season commitment. If a player isn't picked up prior to their last year at college by any owner, none of us get to use him at the pro level!

Payouts will be based around college football awards (Heisman, Biletnikoff, etc.) and, from year 4 onwards, a "normal" fantasy league. There will be no college fantasy football league--the goal is predicting NFL success.

## __Communication__ ##

### Commissioner ###

- Jack Gallagher
- Email: jackgal98@gmail.com
- Philly (South Jersey, anyway) born and raised

### Site ###

- The NFL league will be hosted on MFL from 2024 onwards. The college league will be handled via [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AlMoQlYpHqsF9wkgG6VJtAARKJvzUNCisVIh5fMaJZw/edit?usp=sharing).


### Chat ###

- There will also be a GroupMe chat for everyone in the league. This is definitely the easiest way of communicating as a group and for direct messages. 

## __Money__ ##

### Fees ###

- Half the league dues go to college awards, the other half for fantasy NFL season. Thus the league buy-in is $40 for 2021, 2022, and 2023, and $86 afterwards ($6/yr going to MFL).

- All money collection will be handled by LeagueSafe [(link here)](https://www.leaguesafe.com/join/3997353). Annual league dues will be due the week before the College Player Draft.

- A spreadsheet containing a summary of everyone's current balances [may be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AlMoQlYpHqsF9wkgG6VJtAARKJvzUNCisVIh5fMaJZw/edit?usp=sharing).

## __Basic Rules__ ##

- Hyper C2C will focus on college scouting, thus honing our rookie draft skill for our other dynasty leagues!
- No add/drops or trades any time! Your only way to get players is to have drafted them in the college player draft in April. 
- Best ball! This league is designed to have all the work of managing your roster done in the spring, thus not adding yet another league we have to deal with wavier or start/sit decisions in-season. 
- I'm definitely open to changing rules. 7.5 votes are needed to pass any rule change, with the commish's vote being worth 1.5 votes.

## __League Calendar__ ##

- Our annual, 10-round college player draft will be held each April.
- The orphan supplemental draft, if necessary, will be held in May.
- Once our NFL fantasy season kicks off in 2024, we will have a "normal" dynasty fantasy schedule:

| Segment | Item | Description |
| ------ | ----------- | - |
| Weeks 1-14 | Regular season | Each team plays each other once, plus playing both teams in their division twice. |
| Week 15 | Playoff Quarterfinals | Seed #3 plays Seed #6, Seed #4 plays Seed #5 |
| Week 16 | Playoff Semifinals | Seed #1 plays lowest remaining seed. Seed #2 plays highest remaining seed. |
| Week 17 | Playoff Finals | Winners of two Week 16 games play in championship. Losers of two Week 16 games play in 3rd place consolation game. |
| April | College Player Draft | [see section](#college-player-draft) |
| May | Supplemental Orphan Draft | [see section](#supplemental-orphan-draft) |
| September 1 | Cut-down | All teams must cut down to 40 NFL players on active roster (excl. taxi) (in years 4+) |

## __Drafts__ ##

### College Player Draft ### 

- Each year, sometime in the month of April, we will hold a 10-round linear rookie draft on Fantrax.
- For the first season (where this draft will be held in late August/early September), the draft order will be set at random and the draft will be a snake draft instead of linear.
- For the next two seasons, the draft order will be in reverse order of College Award money winnings.
- Once our inaugural NFL season occurs in the fall of 2024:
    - The order of the 1st thru 9th picks will be based on potential points scored (PP) during Weeks 1-14 of the previous season, in ascending order. All teams who did not place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd are ranked by PP, regardless of if they made the playoffs.
    - The 10th/11th/12th picks will be given to the 3rd/2nd/1st place finishers, respectively.
- All players who are currently enrolled in a college football program, *or* are a high school senior graduating that spring are eligible to be drafted.

### Supplemental Orphan Draft ###

- The Supplemental Orphan Draft, if necessary, will be held sometime in the month of May.
- If a team is orphaned and the commissioner deems the team completely uncompetitive, the orphan can be given some number of supplemental draft picks for 1, 2, and/or 3 years in the future. The commissioner will consult openly with the rest of the league when making the compensation decision.
- The player pool for the supplemental draft are NFL rookies who were not drafted as devys.

## __Divisions__ ##

- There will be 4 divisions, each with 3 teams.
- These are used only for scheduling purposes.

## Lineups ##

### Starting Lineup ###

**2024 lineup:**
- 1 QB/RB/WR/TE flex
- 1 RB
- 1 WR
- 3 Flex RB/WR/TE

To keep up with the added talent to the league, the roster will be upgraded as follows:
- one Flex RB/WR/TE will be added every year until there are 7 RB/WR/TE flexes in 2028.
- the superflex slot turns into a QB-only slot beginning in 2026.
- a second superflex slot will be added in 2028. 

### Roster Limits ###
- Starters: 8 NFL players
- Bench: 32 NFL players
- (players still in college do not count against roster limits)
- No positional maximums
- 4 IR slots, players must be listed as Out, on IR, or on PUP to be put on IR.
  - Once on IR, however, an owner may keep a player in an IR slot even after they are e.g. upgraded to Questionable. Whatever the system allows them to do, they may do. 
  - For example, MFL doesn't give you a score of 0 for an IR violation, but also doesn't allow you to submit a different lineup or perform an add/drop.

### Taxi Squad ###
- up to 10 NFL players with less than 2 years of NFL experience (defined relative to their draft date). 
- you must select your taxi squad players by Sept 1 every year.
- their points do not count towards potential point calculations. You are free to purposefully place better players on your taxi to limit your potential points.
- taxi squad members can be activated to your active roster at any time, provided that there is an open slot. Once activated they are ineligible to be placed back on the taxi squad in the future.
