## __Communication__ ##

### Commissioner ###

- Jack Gallagher
- Email: jackgal98@gmail.com
- Phone: (609) 468-5982

### Site ###

- The league is hosted on MyFantasyLeague. 
- The MFL system allows for communication through the chatbox and through home page modules that the commish will keep updated.

### Chat ###

- There will also be a GroupMe chat for everyone in the league. This is definitely the easiest way of communicating as a group and for direct messages. 

## __Money__ ##

### Fees ###

- The league buy-in is $67. $60 goes towards the pot; the other $7 goes towards paying for the year of MFL.

- All money collection will be handled by LeagueSafe. Annual league dues will be due the week before the Rookie Draft.

- A spreadsheet containing a summary of everyone's current balances [may be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r5HpY153OTXROwGiH4KIZ-GTFk-uRxrDp8emFcNkj5o/).

### __Payouts__ ###

- 1st place: $300
- 2nd place: $180
- 3rd place: $60
- Regular season high points: $50
- Regular season weekly high score: $10/week

## __Basic Rules__ ##

- I'm definitely open to changing rules. 7.5 votes are needed to pass any rule change, with the commish's vote being worth 1.5 votes.

- However, the following items cannot be changed, since they're an integral part of why I created this league in the summer of 2015:

  - 12 owners
  - Superflex
  - No trade veto system being put into place

## __League Calendar__ ##

- The league year begins the Tuesday after Week 16.

## __Rookie-FA Draft__ ##

### Draft ### 

- Each year, sometime in the month of May, we will hold a 4-round rookie draft on MFL.
- The order of the 1st thru 9th picks will be based on potential points scored (PP) during Weeks 1-13 of the previous season, in ascending order. All teams who did not place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd are ranked by PP, regardless of if they made the playoffs.
- The 10th/11th/12th picks will be given to the 3rd/2nd/1st place finishers, respectively.
- All players in the NFL not on rosters are eligible to be picked.
- Roster limits are completely relaxed during the rookie draft, in order to make it easier to just draft and not have to worry about having to cut a player for every pick. 
  - Any clear abuse of this rule will be reversed and the owner scorned by the commish.
- In the week after the rookie draft, everyone must cut back down to the normal 24+4 players, even if they do not intend on making add/drops.

### Future Pick Trading ###
- Only picks up to 2 years in the future are able to be traded, i.e. in the year 2019, picks thru the 2021 rookie draft are able to be traded.
- Trading future 1st or 2nd round picks requires the owner to pre-pay $35 for each year they lose a 1st or 2nd round pick. This rule is in place to prevent selling off one's future and then abandoning the league.

## __Taxi Squad__ ##

- 4-man taxi squad
- For 2019, only rookies are eligible to be placed on it.
- In later years, only rookies and players who were on your taxi squad for the entire prior season may be placed on it. 
  - Example: 
  - You pick *PlayerA* and *PlayerB* in the 3rd and 4th rounds of the 2019 rookie draft, and place them both on your taxi squad come August. 
  - In week 6, you decide to elevate *PlayerA* to your active roster, while *PlayerB* remains on the taxi squad through Week 17.
  - For the 2020 season, *PlayerB* is eligible to be assigned to the taxi squad again, while *PlayerA* is not.
- Must be locked in prior to the start of the regular season.
  - Thus, from the rookie draft thru the end of August, we will have 28-man rosters. After locking in taxi squad players, we will move to 24+4-man rosters.
- No poaching
- Players may be moved up to one's active roster at any time, but once a player has been on a team's active roster, he is no longer eligible to be demoted to the taxi squad at any time in the future.

## __Divisions__ ##

- There will be 2 divisions, each with 6 teams.
- Every year, the divisions will be shuffled, with teams with an odd pick number in the rookie draft order in one divison, even picks in the other.

## __Schedule__ ##

### Weeks 1-13 - Regular Season ###

- Every week, each team plays one other team.
- Each team plays every other team once, and two other teams twice.

### Weeks 14-16 - Playoffs ###

#### Playoff Seeding ####

- Seed 1: Division winner with better record (total points as tiebreaker)
- Seed 2: Other division winner
- Seed 3: Remaining team with best record (total points as tiebreaker)
- Seed 4: Next remaining team with best record (total points as tiebreaker)
- Seed 5: Next remaining team with best record (total points as tiebreaker)
- Seed 6: Next remaining team with most points scored (record as tiebreaker)

#### Week 14 ####

- Seeds 1 and 2 receive a bye.
- Seed 3 plays Seed 6.
- Seed 4 plays Seed 5. 

#### Week 15 ####

- Seed 1 plays the worse remaining seed.
- Seed 2 plays the better remaining seed.

#### Week 16 ####

- The winners of the two Week 15 matchups play for the championship.
- The losers of the two Week 15 matchups play for 3rd place.

#### Playoff Transactions ####

- FAAB pickups are open to all teams throughout the playoffs, even those teams who did not make the playoffs.

### Week 17 ###

- No matchups.
- Start of the next league year.

## __Transactions__ ##

All transactions are free. Your roster must be legal by the start of Sunday's games.

### FAAB Auctions ###
- All add/drops are conducted via FAAB, throughout both the season and offseason. At the start of each league year in Week 17, every team is reset to $100 FAAB, which is their budget until the next season's Week 17.
- $0 bids are allowed.
- FAAB dollars are not tradeable.
- Tie bids are resolved using the MFL default: whoever first submitted the bid gets the player.

### Trades ###
- Trades are automatically processed.
- Trades may only be vetoed by the commish for two reasons: (a) there exists a reasonable suspicion of collusion, or (b) it is so completely lopsided that it palpably disrupts the league's competition. 
- In the event of (a) or (b), the commish will reach out to the owners to explain their thinking. If the commish still believes the trade to be worthy of veto, they will explain their rationale to the league, and barring pushback from non-involved teams, veto the trade.
- There is no trade deadline, but extra discretion will be in force for trades occurring during or near the playoffs.

## Lineups ##

### Starting Lineup ###
- 1 QB
- 1 RB
- 1 WR
- 1 TE
- 1 Flex QB/RB/WR/TE
- 4 Flex RB/WR/TE

### Roster Limits ###
- Starters: 9 players
- Bench: 15 players
- Taxi squad: 4 players
- No positional maximums
- 3 IR slots, players must be listed as Out, on IR, or on PUP to be put on IR.
  - Once on IR, however, an owner may keep a player in an IR slot even after they are e.g. upgraded to Questionable. Whatever the system allows them to do, they may do. 
  - For example, MFL doesn't give you a score of 0 for an IR violation, but also doesn't allow you to submit a different lineup or perform an add/drop.
